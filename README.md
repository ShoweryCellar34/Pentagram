# What is Pentagram?
Pentagram is a basic application framework using SDL, ImGui and GLAD (includes stb_image and glm for convenience) for easy window creation and frameloop. I created this project for [Ghoul Engine](https://github.com/ShoweryCellar34/Ghoul-Engine), I have created an [example app](https://github.com/ShoweryCellar34/Pentagram-Demo.git) for convinience.
