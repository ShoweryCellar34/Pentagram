# What is Pentagram?
Pentagram is a basic application framework using GLFW, ImGui, GLAD, stb, glm, and spdlog for convenient, easy window creation and frameloop. I have created an [example app](https://github.com/ShoweryCellar34/Pentagram-Demo.git) for demonstration.

## How to clone
run this command with [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed to clone this repository:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ShoweryCellar34/Pentagram.git 
```
## Platform support
Penagram uses strictly cross-platform libraries \(Windows, Mac, and Linux support\) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and is primary tested on Windows 11 but has been tested on Ubuntu 24.

## How to use with cmake
Pentagram was designed only with cmake support in mind so precompiled binaries aren't provided.
